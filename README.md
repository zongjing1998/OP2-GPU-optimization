# OP2 memory access optimization on the GPU
Enhancing OP2 framework to Improve GPU Memory Access Performance for Structure based Applications
The original OP2 and more details can see in https://github.com/OP-DSL/OP2-Common

## Start
Firstly, refer to https://github.com/OP-DSL/OP2-Common to install OP2.

Then, Using OP2 to automatically generate parallel code(OpenMP, MPI and CUDA) of complex application.

Finally, to build OP2 again and application.

## Citing
