This directory cointains the Fortran OP2 interface.

To compile it is required to:

1. Set the CUDA_INSTALL_PATH environment variable to the proper value.
   For instance under bash it can be defined as:

       export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH = /usr/local/cuda/

2. Set the OP2 environment variable to the op2 base directory
   which corresponds to the one containing the "c" and "fortran"
   directories.
